# JobHub
Our First Project 

JobHub is a Standalone type software intended to enhance the job advertisement, search, and application
experience for both job seekers and providers, focusing on addressing the difficulties
individuals and companies face during the hiring process. Our goal is to assist job seekers
in securing employment and aid job providers in finding the best candidates by offering an
ideal platform. This project utilized C++ with Object-Oriented Programming, SQLite as the database
management system, and Qt framework for the graphical user interface (GUI) contains
features like ‘Register User/Employer’, ‘Authenticate User/Employer’, ‘Search a Job’,
‘Post a Job’, ‘KYC Update’, ‘Apply for a Job’, ‘Review Application’, ‘Shortlist Candidate’
and ‘Recent Jobs’. This project is to create a portal that improves user experience and acts as a
bridge between job seekers and providers. The database has been an integral part of this project
to store user's data. Besides that, several graphic design platforms like Figma were used for
the basic design of the application concept. JobHub is a unique project that addresses
the drawbacks of existing job application portals by leveraging a justified evaluation
process to create an all-in-one digital solution for job seekers and employers. It's a
simple yet efficient platform connecting job seekers to opportunities and helping employers
find the right talent seamlessly. Its user-friendly interface and extensive job listings make it the go-to solution for a simplified job search or hiring process.
